"""honeypot_connector.py

Summary:
Module provides functionality to integrate with honeypots and gather data deliberately set for attackers.

Extended Summary:
The HoneypotConnector class connects to a specified honeypot, fetches logs, and conducts analyses to identify potential
malicious activities. Using honeypots, organizations can divert attackers and study their behavior without exposing real
assets. This class provides methods for setting up connections to the honeypot, fetching data, and basic analysis.
