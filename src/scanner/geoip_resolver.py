"""geoip_resolver.py

Summary:
Module provides functionality to map IP addresses to geographical locations.

Extended Summary:
The GeoIPResolver class uses an external database or service to determine
the geographic location of an IP address. This can be useful to understand
where traffic is coming from, identify potential security risks based on
geographical patterns, or ensure compliance with data residency requirements.
