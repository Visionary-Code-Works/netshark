"""device_profiler.py

Summary:
Module provides functionality to profile devices based on packet patterns and signatures.

Extended Summary:
The DeviceProfiler class aims to determine the type of device, its operating
system, and even specific device models based on unique packet patterns,
user-agent strings, or other discernible signatures present in packet captures.
This is particularly useful in network environments where the exact inventory
of connected devices is unknown, or for detecting unauthorized devices.
