"""session_reconstructor.py

Summary:
Module provides functionality to rebuild and view entire sessions of specific protocols.

Extended Summary:
The SessionReconstructor class takes in a packet capture and attempts to
reconstruct full sessions based on protocol data. This can be particularly
useful for understanding user behavior, troubleshooting issues, or analyzing
potential security threats.
