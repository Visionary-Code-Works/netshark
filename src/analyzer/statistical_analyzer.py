9. **Class: `StatisticalAnalyzer`**
    - Purpose: Provide statistical data about the capture.

    **Methods**:
    - `get_packet_length_distribution(self, capture)`: Display a distribution of packet sizes.
    - `get_traffic_trends(self, capture)`: Analyze the traffic trend over time (e.g., hourly or by minute).
    - `get_peak_traffic_time(self, capture)`: Identify when the peak traffic occurred.
