# CHANGELOG

## **TODOs**

1. Add a `README.md` at the root of your directory.
2. Set up a virtual environment for Python.
3. Ensure you have a `.gitignore` file for Git version control.
4. Implement a proper logging mechanism.
5. Expand the `tests` directory with tests for each module.
6. Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for automated testing.
7. Plan for database directory and potential migrations (if applicable).
8. Fill out `LICENSE` correctly and add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
9. Enhance error handling and consider a centralized error handler.
10. Manage configuration settings with environment variables.
11. Design a system for data backup and recovery.
12. Implement tools or utilities for performance monitoring.
13. Handle API authentication and authorization (if applicable).

## **Estimated Time Frame**

1. **README**: 1-2 hours. This depends on the complexity of the project.
2. **Virtual Environment**: 30 minutes to 1 hour.
3. **.gitignore**: 15-30 minutes.
4. **Logging**: 1-3 hours, depending on the complexity and extent of logging required.
5. **Expand Tests**: This can vary greatly, but start with 2-4 hours per module.
6. **CI Pipeline**: 2-5 hours, depending on the platform and complexity.
7. **Database Setup**: 2-5 hours initially, but can be more if migrations are complex.
8. **LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md**: 1-2 hours.
9. **Error Handling**: 2-4 hours, depending on how much is already in place.
10. **Environment Variables**: 1-2 hours.
11. **Data Backup/Recovery**: 3-6 hours, more if the solution is complex.
12. **Performance Monitoring**: 2-5 hours for basic monitoring, but can be more for detailed insights.
13. **API Authentication**: 3-5 hours, but can vary based on the method (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
