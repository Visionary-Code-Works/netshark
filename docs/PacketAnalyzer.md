    - `map_device_interactions(self, capture)`: Generate a mapping of which devices communicated with which.
    - `visualize_topology(self, capture)`: Create a visual representation of the network topology.

7. **Class: `ApplicationAnalyzer`**
    - Purpose: Identify and categorize application-level protocols and their metadata.

    **Methods**:
    - `detect_app_protocols(self, capture)`: Identify application-level protocols like HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.
    - `extract_http_metadata(self, capture)`: Extract HTTP headers, methods, user-agents, etc.
    - `extract_dns_queries(self, capture)`: Extract DNS queries and responses.

8. **Class: `ContentAnalyzer`**
    - Purpose: Analyze and extract content from packets for deeper insight.

    **Methods**:
    - `extract_file_transfers(self, capture)`: Identify and extract files transferred over protocols like HTTP or FTP.
    - `search_keywords(self, capture, keywords)`: Search for specific keywords in the packet content.
    - `decode_base64_content(self, capture)`: Decode any Base64 encoded content within packets.

9. **Class: `StatisticalAnalyzer`**
    - Purpose: Provide statistical data about the capture.

    **Methods**:
    - `get_packet_length_distribution(self, capture)`: Display a distribution of packet sizes.
    - `get_traffic_trends(self, capture)`: Analyze the traffic trend over time (e.g., hourly or by minute).
    - `get_peak_traffic_time(self, capture)`: Identify when the peak traffic occurred.

10. **Utility Functions** (can be part of a utilities module or within the main class):
    - `read_pcap(file_path)`: Wrapper around pyshark's pcap reading.
    - `save_analysis_to_file(analysis_data, output_file)`: Save the analysis results to a specified file.
    - Other utility functions as required.

11. **Main Execution Logic**:
    - Parse command-line arguments (using argparse or another method).
    - Initialize `PacketAnalyzer` with the provided pcap file.
    - Depending on user's choice, execute the specific analysis.
    - Optionally, save results to a file.

---

These additional classes provide a richer set of functionalities, from understanding network topology to extracting and analyzing content within the packets. Remember, the complexity of the program will increase with the addition of these classes, so you'll need to ensure each class is well-defined and thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy and performance.

To use this program, one could:

1. Load the pcap file.
2. Select a type of analysis (traffic, security, performance).
3. View or export the results.

Certainly! The realm of cybersecurity is vast, and while the above program offers a solid foundation for packet capture analysis, there are many other tasks and functionalities that can be explored within the context of cybersecurity and packet captures. Here are some additional tasks and potential classes or modules you might consider:

1. **Anomaly Detection**:
    - **Class: `AnomalyDetector`**
        - Detect unusual patterns or outliers in the traffic.
        - Identify sudden spikes in traffic, unusual times of activity, or uncommon protocols being used.
        - Machine learning can be employed for more advanced anomaly detection.

2. **Signature-based Detection**:
    - **Class: `SignatureMatcher`**
        - Match packets against known signatures of malicious activity.
        - Update and manage a signature database.

3. **Behavioral Analysis**:
    - **Class: `BehaviorAnalyzer`**
        - Look for sequences of packets or actions that represent known malicious behavior patterns.
        - Identify Command and Control (C2) communications, lateral movement, etc.

4. **Session Reconstruction**:
    - **Class: `SessionReconstructor`**
        - Rebuild and view entire sessions of specific protocols (e.g., viewing a full web browsing session).

5. **Decryption & Encryption Detection**:
    - **Class: `CryptoAnalyzer`**
        - Identify encrypted communications.
        - Where possible and legal, attempt to decrypt or identify the encryption method used.

6. **Geo-IP Analysis**:
    - **Class: `GeoIPResolver`**
        - Map IP addresses to geographical locations.
        - Identify potentially suspicious traffic sources based on geographic location.

7. **Forensic Timestamp Analysis**:
    - **Class: `TimeForensics`**
        - Identify and analyze the timing and sequence of packets/events for forensic purposes.
        - Look for evidence of time manipulation or inconsistencies.

8. **Malware Analysis**:
    - **Class: `MalwareScanner`**
        - Extract payloads and files from packet captures.
        - Scan these payloads against malware databases or analyze them in sandboxed environments.

9. **Honeypot Integration**:
    - **Class: `HoneypotConnector`**
        - Integrate with honeypots to gather and analyze data from deliberate traps set for attackers.

10. **Tor and VPN Detection**:
    - **Class: `PrivacyNetworkDetector`**
